# TricTrak MVP - Project Charter

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the development of an open-source alternative to TricTrak, a proprietary web-based application for trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) detection and intervention. Through comprehensive analysis of TricTrak's interface, functionality, and underlying technology stack, we have developed a Python-based MVP that replicates core detection capabilities while maintaining privacy and extensibility.

## Project Background

### Problem Statement
Trichotillomania affects 1-2% of the global population, causing significant distress and functional impairment. TricTrak represents a breakthrough in digital intervention tools, using real-time computer vision to detect and interrupt hair-pulling behaviors before they occur. However, as a proprietary web service, it presents limitations in terms of:

- **Privacy concerns**: Data processing on external servers
- **Accessibility**: Subscription-based model limiting access
- **Extensibility**: Closed-source nature prevents customization
- **Research limitations**: No access to underlying algorithms for academic study

### Project Vision
Create an open-source, privacy-preserving alternative to TricTrak that:
- Matches or exceeds detection accuracy
- Runs entirely on local hardware
- Provides transparent, auditable algorithms
- Enables customization for individual needs
- Supports research and community development

#### Alert System
```javascript
// Alert Types Observed
- None (silent monitoring)
- Alarm (attention-grabbing tone)
- Beep (subtle notification)
- Vibrate (haptic feedback on mobile)
- Whistle (sharp audio cue)
- Affirmations (positive reinforcement audio)

// Delay Options
- 0s (immediate)
- 1s, 2s, 3s (configurable delays)
```

### Detection Algorithm Insights

#### Proximity Calculation Method
Based on behavior analysis and performance characteristics, TricTrak likely uses:

1. **Multi-point Sampling**: Rather than single-point distance, uses weighted averages of multiple fingertip positions
2. **Region-specific Thresholds**: Different sensitivity for scalp (looser) vs. eyebrows (tighter)
3. **Temporal Consistency**: Minimum persistence time (~300ms) before alert activation
4. **Hand State Classification**: Distinguishes between open palm and pinching gestures

#### Performance Optimization
- **Selective Processing**: Hand detection only when hands visible in frame
- **Frame Rate Optimization**: Targets 30 FPS for smooth real-time performance
- **SIMD Acceleration**: WebAssembly SIMD for mathematical operations
- **Model Caching**: Efficient loading and reuse of MediaPipe models
